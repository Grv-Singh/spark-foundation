##### Problem 1 Supervised Machine Learning :

Predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear
regression task as it involves just two variables.

Below is the predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a
day.

##### Problem 2 Unsupervised Machine Learning :

From the ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of
clusters and represent it visually.

##### Problem 3 Decision Tree Algorithm :

On ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and
visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
